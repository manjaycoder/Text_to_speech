# Text-to-Speech Application using Pygame and gTTS

This is a simple Text-to-Speech (TTS) application that utilizes **Pygame** for the graphical interface and **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)** for text-to-speech conversion. The user inputs text, and the program converts it to speech and plays it.

## Features

- Convert any input text into speech using gTTS.
- Play the speech using Pygame's sound functionalities.
- Simple and easy-to-use interface (if applicable).
  
## Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- **pygame**: A set of Python modules designed for writing video games, but used here to play the audio.
- **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)**: A Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Text-to-Speech API.

To install these dependencies, use pip:

```bash
pip install pygame gTTS
